# Blog Hog _the blog of blogs_
This is a simple blog that allows users to create profiles and contribute to a communal list of blog entries. Each user can like and unlike posts that are not their own, and comment on posts. They can edit and delete their own comments, but not those of others. There is also a profile/welcome page that displays a list of all the users posts, and a list of all posts (with links) that the user has liked. The user can delete their profile, which first deletes all the posts they've contributed to the blog, then removes their data from the database.
